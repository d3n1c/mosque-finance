Core of all my drupal modules toys

This module contains several important functions commonly or frequently used in a lot of scripting that we did.
All drupal module that we make use of many standard functions in this module.

In addition the module also has a sub-modules that are useful to bridge the content type to be used in the overall scripting.
Naming content type and fields that exist within the Drupal framework can be different for each user,
but can be generalized use of this module, making it easier to interact with.
